**Credit Card Default Prediction**

This repository contains a Python-based data science project that focuses on predicting credit card default based on essential variables, including income, age, loan amount, and an engineered feature "Loan to Income." The dataset comprises 2000 samples from each of two categories: default and non-default.

**Steps:**
1. **Data Exploration:** Understand the dataset's structure and analyze the key variables' distribution to gain insights.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, engineer the "Loan to Income" feature, and prepare the data for model training.

3. **Model Selection:** Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting) for credit card default prediction.

4. **Model Training:** Train the selected model on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and relationships.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Prediction:** Utilize the trained model to predict credit card defaults on unseen data.

By exploring the code and dataset in this repository, you can gain valuable insights into credit card default prediction and understand the factors contributing to credit risk.
