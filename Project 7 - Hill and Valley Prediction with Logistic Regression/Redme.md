**Hill and Valley Prediction with Logistic Regression**

This repository presents a Python-based data science project that aims to predict whether a data sample corresponds to a "Hill" or "Valley" using logistic regression. The dataset consists of samples from the "Hill Valley" dataset, and the code demonstrates the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation:** Import the required libraries and read the dataset from GitHub, exploring its structure and summary statistics.

2. **Target and Features:** Define the target variable "Class" (Hill or Valley) and the predictor variables "X" by dropping the target column.

3. **Data Visualization:** Visualize the first two rows of the dataset, plotting the pattern for "Hill" and "Valley."

4. **Data Standardization:** Standardize the feature variables to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

5. **Train-Test Split:** Split the data into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

6. **Model Selection:** Choose Logistic Regression as the predictive model and train it on the training data.

7. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict the class labels on the test data and calculate the probability of each prediction.

8. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics like a confusion matrix and classification report.

The repository showcases how logistic regression can be utilized for the classification task of predicting "Hill" and "Valley" patterns, providing insights into the relationship between the input features and the target classes.
