**Fish Weight Prediction with Linear Regression**

This code implements a simple Linear Regression model to predict the weight of fish based on their characteristic features. The dataset contains information on various fish species, including their vertical length, diagonal length, cross length, height, and diagonal width. Using these characteristics, we aim to predict the fish's weight in grams.

**Features:**
- Species: The name of the fish species.
- Weight: The weight of the fish in grams (target variable).
- Length1: Vertical length of the fish in centimeters.
- Length2: Diagonal length of the fish in centimeters.
- Length3: Cross length of the fish in centimeters.
- Height: Height of the fish in centimeters.
- Width: Diagonal width of the fish in centimeters.

We will apply Linear Regression to establish a relationship between the fish's characteristics and their weight, thereby enabling us to predict the weight of fish with reasonable accuracy. The outcome of this analysis may provide valuable insights into the factors influencing fish weight and contribute to broader research in fisheries and marine biology.
