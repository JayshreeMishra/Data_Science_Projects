**Customer Purchase Prediction & Effect of Micro-Numerosity**

This repository contains a Python-based data science project that aims to predict customer purchase behavior based on various factors such as age, gender, education, and review ratings. The project follows these steps:

1. **Import Library:** Import the required libraries, including pandas for data manipulation.

2. **Import Data:** Load the customer purchase dataset from a CSV file hosted on GitHub and display its basic information and statistics.

3. **Data Preparation:** Define the target variable (purchased) and features (age, gender, education, and review ratings) for the model. Encode categorical variables to numerical values.

4. **Train-Test Split:** Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

5. **Select Model:** Choose the Random Forest Classifier model for this prediction task.

6. **Train Model:** Fit the Random Forest Classifier model on the training data.

7. **Predict Model:** Use the trained model to predict customer purchase behavior on the test data.

8. **Model Accuracy:** Evaluate the model's accuracy using metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report.

The results indicate the model's performance in predicting customer purchase behavior, considering precision, recall, and accuracy. Feel free to explore the code and dataset in this repository to understand the insights gained from customer purchase prediction.
