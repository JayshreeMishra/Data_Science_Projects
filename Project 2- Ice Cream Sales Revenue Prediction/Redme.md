Data Science Regression Model for Ice Cream Revenue Prediction

This repository contains a Python-based data science project that builds a regression model to predict ice cream revenue based on temperature. 

The results indicate that the model achieves a reasonably low MAE and MAPE, indicating its effectiveness in predicting ice cream revenue based on temperature.
